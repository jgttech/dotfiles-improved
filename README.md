# Personal Dotfiles Ecosystem

Because I am insane and love to program for fun. I decided that each just having some dotfiles is not enough for me. I wanted my dotfiles to also be a strange place where I can install varients of those tools written in different languages, as I see fit, whenever I feel like it. This is just to have some fun with my own tools and also gain some experience in other languages building CLI-based applications.

# Installation

This invokes the install script and builds the built-in CLI.

```bash
wget -qO- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jgttech/dotfiles/refs/heads/main/bin/install" | bash
```

# Development
